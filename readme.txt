aoc_2022_x_1 = part 1 of x day, some may only have one due to the logic solving both parts
to run a particular part on a day, the source of which javascript file must be changed 
on line 15 in the html file

some things are over commented, some things aren't commented

the main idea is to open the aoc_2022_index.html and open the input .txt file to
retrieve an output. If no output is shown in the html, check the console. 

if the result returns NaN's or undefined -- check the encoding of the text file OR
copy and paste the data into a new file with CRLF encoding and re-run.

the entirity of aoc_2022 will be done in vanilla JavaScript in order for me to get more
practice with the language 

just say it. i'm nothing but a cottonheaded ninnymuggins.
